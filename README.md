# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach to Retention

## Executive Summary

Customer churn remains one of the most critical challenges in the telecommunications industry, significantly affecting revenue and growth. This project leverages advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, uncover key drivers of attrition, and provide actionable insights to optimize retention strategies. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and account information, this project not only builds a predictive churn model but also offers tailored recommendations to help telecom companies enhance customer loyalty. The final model is deployed via Streamlit for an interactive user experience, enabling real-time decision-making.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on the **Telecom Customer Churn** dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset captures a diverse set of features across customer demographics, service usage, and account details, making it ideal for building a predictive churn model. The dataset includes:

* **Demographics:**
  - Customer attributes such as gender, age (senior citizen status), marital status (partnered or dependent).
  
* **Services:**
  - Information about the customer's subscriptions: phone, internet (DSL, fiber optic), online security, backup, device protection, tech support, streaming services (TV, movies), etc.
  
* **Account Information:**
  - Key account features: tenure (how long the customer has been with the company), contract type, paperless billing, payment method, monthly charges, and total charges.
  
* **Churn Status:**
  - The target variable indicating whether the customer churned (Yes/No).

## Methodology

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   In-depth exploratory analysis is conducted to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data. Visualizations and statistical tests help us understand the distribution of churn across various features and identify factors that most strongly correlate with customer attrition.

   ##Insights:
* **Month-to-month contracts**: Customers on flexible, short-term plans are more likely to churn, lacking long-term commitment.
*   **Absence of online security and tech support**: Customers without these services tend to leave more often.
*   **Longer tenure and two-year contracts**: Customers who stay longer or sign up for longer terms show lower churn, indicating stronger loyalty.
*  **Value-added services**: Offering services like online security, streaming TV, online backup, and tech support—especially without requiring an internet connection—correlates with reduced churn.


### 2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Data preprocessing is a crucial step to prepare the dataset for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing any potential data imbalances to ensure optimal model performance.

### 3. **Model Development**  
   A range of machine learning algorithms are employed to build and assess predictive models for churn:
   - **Logistic Regression:** A foundational algorithm for binary classification tasks, offering interpretability and simplicity.
   - **Random Forest:** A robust ensemble method known for its ability to capture complex relationships and interactions within the data.
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful classifier suited for both linear and non-linear decision boundaries.
   - **XGBoost:** A state-of-the-art gradient boosting model that offers high predictive accuracy, especially on large datasets.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**  
   The performance of each model is evaluated using key metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**. The best-performing model is selected based on its ability to accurately predict churn while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

### 5. **Model Comparison**  
   The models are compared to determine which one provides the most reliable and actionable predictions for churn. This step ensures that the chosen model is both accurate and suitable for real-world deployment.

### 6. **Actionable Insights & Recommendations**  
   Based on the model’s findings, actionable business insights are derived to inform retention strategies. These insights help telecom companies understand the root causes of churn and implement targeted interventions to reduce attrition.

### 7. **Deployment with Streamlit**  
   The final predictive model is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web application where users can input customer details and receive real-time churn predictions, enabling proactive decision-making.

## Key Findings

Our analysis reveals several key drivers of customer churn:

* **Contract Type:**  
  Customers on month-to-month contracts are significantly more likely to churn compared to those on one- or two-year contracts. Longer-term commitments seem to foster greater customer loyalty.
  
* **Tenure:**  
  A strong negative correlation exists between customer tenure and churn. Newer customers (shorter tenure) are more likely to leave the service, highlighting the importance of early-stage retention efforts.
  
* **Demographics:**  
  Customers who are senior citizens, or those without partners or dependents, exhibit higher churn rates. Tailored retention strategies can address these specific demographic groups.
  
* **Service Features:**  
  The absence of certain services, such as online security, tech support, or streaming options, increases churn risk. Customers who opt for more comprehensive service bundles are less likely to churn.
  
* **Pricing:**  
  Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates. Customers who feel they are not getting value for money may be more inclined to switch providers.

## Strategic Marketing Recommendations

Based on the churn predictors identified, we propose the following strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention:

1. **Personalized Retention Campaigns:**  
   Tailor retention offers based on customer attributes, usage patterns, and tenure. Special incentives or discounts can be offered to high-risk customers, particularly those on month-to-month contracts or with shorter tenures.

2. **Service Bundling & Upselling:**  
   Create personalized service bundles that add value for customers. For example, offering a combination of internet, online security, and tech support can improve retention, especially for customers currently without these services.

3. **Proactive Customer Support:**  
   Invest in customer service teams to offer proactive support, especially to customers with higher churn risk. This can include offering tech support, follow-up calls, or even loyalty programs that increase the perceived value of staying with the company.

4. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:**  
   Reevaluate pricing models, particularly for customers with high monthly charges, and consider introducing loyalty discounts for long-term customers. Ensuring that pricing remains competitive can reduce the risk of churn.

5. **Targeted Campaigns for At-Risk Demographics:**  
   Focus on retaining senior citizens or customers without partners by offering tailored plans that address their specific needs, such as discounts on basic services or added customer support.
